    <h2>The best meal to have following a <em>Rainy Night</em></h2>
    <p>
        Bhuna khichuri recipe is an exemplary moong dal khichuri which is immensely popular in Bangladesh, West Bengal and few other parts of north east India. The texture of bhuna khichuri is completely different from other khichuri recipes. It is dry and grainy in texture exactly like pulao with extraordinary taste and flavour. In this preparation, gobindobhog chaal (Small grain rice) and shona moong dal (Split yellow lentils) are fried together and then cooked in hot water with some specific spices and fried onions. It always requires a side for a complete meal. It is mostly accompanied with egg curry, chicken curry, mutton kosha or paneer curry.
